# Portfolio-Page
- This is my portfolio to show prospective employers my work and for them to learn a little bit about me.  This is so they can see what my strengths and weaknesses are and decide whether we are a good fit or if my skills are needed in their workplace.  I also included some personal information about who I am and what I like to do in my free time.
