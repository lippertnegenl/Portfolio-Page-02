                <p> Hi, My name is Lucas and I am in the process of taking a 12 week coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.  I graduated HighSchool from New London-Spicer 
                Minnesota in 2006.  I currently live in Hutchinson MN with my Girlfriend Meghan Doll and one year old son Ronan Lippert.  We have two cats
                and a dog. The dog's name is Casper and he is an English cream golden retriever which makes him an all white golden retriever.  I prefer this breed over the american golden retriever 
                because he is much less energetic but still keeps that great golden retriever attitude and demeanor.  The two cats names are Oscar and Sunny, they are both Orange Tabbies.  Ronan
                continues to be a focal point in our lives and brings much joy. Below you can see pictures of Ronan, Meghan, and Casper.  In my free time I like to fish, golf, and spend time with my 
                family.
